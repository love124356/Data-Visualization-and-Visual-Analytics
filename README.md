# Data-Visualization-and-Visual-Analytics
This repo collects all the homework for Data Visualization and Visual Analytics, NYCU

We use the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to do these assignments.

## Homework 1
- The goal is to implement a web-based **scatter plot** to show the iris dataset by using D3
- Users should be able to determine the x-axis (and y-axis) to show the values of one of the attributes, such as **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width**, when interacting with the tool
- Besides, please **render scatter points in different colors** to represent the flower classes (three in total)
- In this case, the attribute relations of different flowers can be further visualized

## Homework 2
- The goal is to implement a web-based **parallel coordinate plot** to show the iris dataset (the same as Homework 1) using D3
- Users should be able to **change the order of the axis** because the attribute relations are difficult to observe if they are far away
- Besides, please **render poly-lines (flower samples)** in different hues to represent the flower classes (three in total)
- In this case, the attribute relations of different flowers can be further visualized

## Homework 3
- The goal is to implement an integrated system that can show the insight of [Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset?resource=download)
- Free to decide which idioms to use and how interactions to provide in the system
